# Mars Rover
This project has been assigned in completion of an assessment to ascertain technical ability.

The language chosen is *Python*. The version of Python tested against is version 3.6.4 but the code should be backwards compatible to all versions of Python 3.

Other than **sys** (in order to extract argument parameters) no packages have been used.

## Executing
To execute the script type: *python mars_rover.py <test_script>*

A further piece of work executes the script but gives a visual representation of the progress of the various rovers. This can be executed by typing: *python mars_rover_visual.py <test_script>*

In the event that a Python interpreter is not available, an executable built from the script has been provided. 

This can be executed by running: *mars_rover.exe <test_script>*

## Assumptions
None
